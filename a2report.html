			<h2>Subtheme: Exclusionary Zoning</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Which municipalities most prominently have single-family zoning laws? In particular, are single-family zoning laws in Boston concentrated amongst certain municipalities, or are they distributed relatively evenly across all municipalities, especially in consideration of the size of the affected population within a municipality? Is there a geographic pattern to the distribution? I'm curious to investigate this because of my own personal experience in Washington state, where there is complexity to zoning laws not only within Seattle proper, but also (and especially) amongst cities on the eastside (e.g., Bellevue, Redmond, Renton, Tacoma, etc.). In these cities one can more prominently see a wealth gap and lack of housing affordability even more apparently. I'd be interested to know what the distribution looks like for municipalities in Boston.</li>
				<li>Are zoning laws tied to any specific urban planning features, such as public transportation locations, major highways, waterways, schools, industrial regions, etc? If so, are different types of urban planning features consistently considered more "desirable" to single-family zoning in Boston? I'm interested in this after reading the provided New York Times article (<i>Cities Start to Question an American Ideal</i>), which highlighted key urban planning features such as a new light rail (in LA), an industrial area (in North Carolina), and a major state route (in Georgia) as part of annotations in their visualizations.</li>
				<li>What is the racial demographic of different municipalities, and are there patterns across municipalities with more restrictive zoning laws? Does the data indeed seem to indicate that single-family zoning laws do indeed disproportionately affect minorities, such as people of color or low-income communities? I'd like to investigate this after reading and watching "Exclusionary by Design", where they discussed how intertwined zoning laws have been to the problem of affordable housing over the past decade in Boston. I'd like to look at race specifically considering that I've seen Boston and Massachusetts as a whole additionally have a reputation of being a predominantly white city from my friends outside of Massachusetts, and I'd imagine that that might impact the how the data compares between different municipalities.</li>

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

					I first had a look to see what the rough geographic distribution of the municipalities is. There are 101 unique municipalities in the dataset, which suggests that approximately 50% of municipalities have data for both single-family and non-single-family zoning restrictions. It appears that there is good coverage of east Massachusetts in the dataset, although certain geographic areas appear to lack data or are otherwise not included in a municipality; I'd be curious to know if this is because the land is otherwise protected or inhabitable (e.g. a state park or a body of water), if they are accounted for in a different way, or if there is some other error. This visualization additionally indicates the municipalities containing at least one zone with some single-family restrictions in brown. I don't notice any significant or consistent geographic pattern, although it does appear that municipalities with single-family zoning laws appear to be suburban.

				I then began to investigate population data. The above visualizations show (1) the population distribution across all municipalities, with one standout outlier (Boston) followed by (2) the population distribution excluding the municipality of Boston, visualized in order to better see the actual distribution. I thought that the population counts looked reasonable scale-wise and relatively well-distributed, and the outlier for Boston made sense. However, when I repeated the visualizations to look at rows containing only single-family zoning, some populations looked abnormally low (Essex at 9 people, for instance). This might suggest some errors or typos in the population data (altneratively, there may be a story for why a handful of numbers look very small).

				To both dive deeper into the tiny population counts found in the prior visualization, as well as to investigate my first guiding question, I focused specifically on municipalities with both types of zoning laws, and compared the population counts for either zoning type. I was intrigued to see that although many municipalities with both zoning types are split somewhat evenly between the categories, there are a significant number of municipalities that are almost entirely either "not single family" or entirely "single family," with just a very small population under the other category: Revere, Gloucester, Milton, and Burlington are examples. I suspect that these municipalities contain just a handful of zones that lie under a different zone classification than their majority classification; this might suggest that very small changes in zoning law may have been made or surrendered by municipalities in response to new state policy or public opinon. Thus, in response to my first guiding question, it appears that certain municipalities do indeed have histories or tendencies to strongly prefer single-family-zoning policies, and zoning laws are not at all evenly distributed across the state.

				For more map-based visualizations, I wanted to look at percent of land under single family zoning restrictions, since I imagine that land percentages might be more stable and reliable than recording and tracking households and their sizes. However, I wanted to double check that the land percentage data roughly made sense. This visualization, which explores the data based on the "only single family" field, is rather interesting. First, we do see that the rows containing single-family-zoned information do indeed indicate high percentages of single-family-zoned land, and vice versa, which aligns with our expectations. However, we also notice that there are odd spikes at the histogram's leftmost, 0-10% bucket. Upon further investigation in the dataset, it appears that many municipalities have simply been marked with 0%-single-family-zoned land, which feels somewhat unlikely. For the following visualizations, I chose to either include or exclude these municipalities depending on the specific investigation being done, since I was not able to find a concrete indication of whether this data pattern was legitimate or an error.

				Unfortunately, there wasn't a lot of available data to try and answer my second guiding question; the only external, urban infrastructure related information contained in the dataset was MBTA community data. I mapped this out here, marking the non-MBTA communities in red. However, I immediately found that this data field wasn't particularly useful. There were only four municipalities that weren't considered MBTA communities, and no differentiation between all of the remaining ones; additionally, the municipality of Boston itself wasn't considered an MBTA community, which seems odd to me. I thus did some extra research about what MBTA communities are and how they are divided. In researching, it appears that new legislation is using them to enact new zoning laws. In particular, it appears that <a href="https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/what-the-mbta-communities-law-means-for-your-town/" target="_blank">municipalities with proportionally higher access to transit will be required to add or change zones to allow for more multi-family housing units</a> as part of work done by Governor Healey in 2021 (<a href="https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/02/15/milton-to-face-legal-repercussions-lose-state-funding-after-rejecting-mbta-communities-act/" target="_blank">although this February 2024 news article suggests that some municipalities like Milton are bullishly refusing to comply</a>). Although I wasn't able to get any other data (for instance, the per-municipality thresholds to update zoning requirements, or even post-2021 zoning data) to extend this visualization, these initial investigations allowed me to make some interesting discoveries through reading and research.

				Despite the lack of data, I did want to try to annotate a map to investigate urban planning patterns, in order to better understand the shape of the data. In particular, I looked at the locations of major cities (including Lowell, which amongst other towns in northern Massachusetts has historical significance as being influential industrially); and the locations of major Massachusetts highways and public transport systems. Visualized here are MBTA commuter rail routes, which to me represent a more accessible and affordable method of transport than a highway and thus were more interesting. There does not appear to be any significant relationship to my eye at first (although I admit I am not entirely familiar with Massachusetts geography beyond greater Boston), although one might hypothesize that areas with more single-family-zoned-land seem to be located closer to commuter rail routes. This could indicate that land nearer to rail routes might be seen as more residential or valuable to live in, and also suggests that people living in less restrictive areas may struggle more to find accessible commute.

				In order to answer my final question, I first had a look at municipalities' racial distribution, compared to their single-family-zoning land percentages. I chose to first investigate it visually, looking to see what sorts of zoning laws are enforced by municipalities with higher proportions of people of color. My first finding in doing this was that Massachusetts' racial distribution is much more predominantely white outside of the greater Boston metro area, which aligns with my intuition. The map doesn't really show any clear pattern in municipalities, and additionally it suffers from the data issue identified in the fourth visualization, aside from one geographical note: in Boston and in the municipalities around it, there appear to be both higher proportions of white people, and somewhat less restrictive zoning laws.

				To look more closely at this data, I chose to plot it in a scatterplot, with each point representing one municipality. I looked at correlations between land zoning percentanges and different racial demographics, and in order to add some clarity to my investigation, here I chose to exclude municipalities that had the odd 0%-zoning-land data issue, reducing the clutter along the x-axis. Although there was no clear trend or pattern within different racial minority groups (for instance, you can see that circle size varies relatively randomly along the y-axis in the above visualization), the geographical pattern that was somewhat visible in the map does appear to align. Moreover, the scatterplot seems to indicate more broadly that municipalities with higher percentages of white people do indeed tend to also have more single-family-zoning restrictions.

				Because there appeared to be a correlation by race, I wanted to have a quick look at income data as well. However, as there is a lot of income data, especially when looking across all the municipalities, I went through multiple iterations of visualizations, focusing on different subgroups of municipalities as well as different income brackets. Ultimately, I decided to further aggregate the income data into buckets beyond what the raw data had aggregated it into, aggregating across rows and then bucketing every $50k: although this loses some important information, especially on the lower-end of the income spectrum, I felt that such partitioning was best suited for a general visualization. This visualization furthermore only looks at income data for municipalities with high percentages of single-family-zoned land, in order to avoid the aforementioned data quality issue. It very strongly indicates that household incomes for such municipalities are very high across the board, with a pretty large proportion of municipalities having near or over 50% of households with incomes $150K+, and all but a handful having near or over 50% of households with incomes $100K+. This finding supports the notion that single-family-zoning disproportionately affects lower-income households' abilities to find affordable housing.

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>These visualizations thus paint an interesting picture of the data, although my primary reactions to the investigations have been many further questions and concerns about the data. I think that although the metadata provides very necessary information about what the data fields represent, I'd need to do a lot more investigation into how different numbers were aggregated and calculated from the various Census sources in order to feel confident about the different numbers provided in the data. Despite this, however, I think that my investigations demonstrated to me that there do appear that zoning patterns across Massachusetts municipalities are deeply uneven depending on the specific municipality. Indeed, it appears that race and especially income bracket can be very good estimators and indicators of what zoning restrictions in a certain Massachusetts municipality might look like, and during future investigations, I'd love to dive deeper into specific municipalities and look at zone-level data, trying to better identify particular zones of interest and patterns across them in order to have less aggregated, more differentiable insights into minority groups and low-income communities.</p>
